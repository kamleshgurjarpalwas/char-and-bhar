# Nine Men's Morris (Char and Bhar)

**Nine Men's Morris** (also known as *Char and Bhar*) is an ancient two-player strategy board game. Each player has nine pieces, and the board consists of 24 points where pieces can be placed. Players alternate turns placing pieces on empty points, aiming to form **mills** (three pieces in a row). When a mill is formed, the player immediately removes one of the opponent's pieces from the board.

After all pieces are placed, players take turns moving their pieces to adjacent empty points along the board's lines. Players continue to form mills and capture pieces during this phase. The game ends when one player is reduced to two pieces or cannot make a legal move. In that case, the other player wins.
